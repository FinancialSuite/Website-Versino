            <h2>Reporting Extension Pack (Reporting)</h2>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The <b>Versino Reporting Module</b> is the central reporting system of the Financial Suite. It offers an extensive collection of pre-made Crystal Reports and works entirely in the background to provide you with the appropriate analyses. A key advantage is that the module automatically detects whether you are using a <b>Microsoft SQL Server</b> or <b>SAP HANA</b> database and loads the corresponding, performance-optimized reports.</p>
            <p>The module starts asynchronously without blocking the SAP Business One interface and automatically detects your system language. <b>Access to the reports:</b> All reports can be found in the SAP Business One menu under <b>Versino Financial Suite > Financial Suite Reports</b>.</p>

            <h3>Main Features</h3>
            <p>The module offers two types of reports to cover different requirements:</p>

            <h4>Standard Reports</h4>
            <p>These reports can be started directly and offer quick evaluations. Filtering (e.g., by date) is done directly in the Crystal Reports Viewer.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cash Book:</b> Shows all cash transactions chronologically with a running balance.</li>
                <li><b>G/L Account Statement:</b> Detailed transaction lists for selected G/L accounts.</li>
                <li><b>Customer Open Items:</b> Overview of unpaid receivables with aging analysis.</li>
                <li><b>Trial Balance (SuSa):</b> Compact overview of all accounts.</li>
                <li><b>Top 10 Customers/Vendors:</b> Ranking of the most important business partners.</li>
                <li><b>Payment Behavior:</b> Analysis of customer payment behavior.</li>
                <li><b>BWA:</b> Monthly business analysis report.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Mass Reports</h4>
            <p>These reports offer special filter dialogs before starting, to carry out targeted mass processing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Balance Confirmation:</b> Creates separate confirmation letters for any number of customers for a selectable key date.</li>
                <li><b>Netting Reconciliations:</b> Documents completed netting processes.</li>
                <li><b>Payment Advice:</b> Creates detailed payment advices for a specific payment run.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Output Options</h4>
            <p>All reports can be directly displayed, printed, or exported to formats such as <b>PDF, Excel, or Word</b>. For mass reports, individual file names are automatically assigned (e.g., "BalanceConfirmation_[CustomerCode].pdf").</p>

            <h3>Application</h3>
            
            <h4>Using a Standard Report (e.g., Account Statement)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Navigate to <b>Versino Financial Suite > Financial Suite Reports > G/L Account Statement</b>.</li>
                <li>A filter dialog opens. Enter the desired <b>time period</b>, the <b>G/L accounts</b>, and the display type (B1 form or as an external Windows form).</li>
                <li>Click "OK". The report is generated.</li>
                <li>Use the viewer's export functions to save the report.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Using a Mass Report (e.g., Balance Confirmation)</h4>

            <h3>Tips and Troubleshooting</h3>

            <h5>Problem: A report is empty or shows no data.</h5>
            <p><b>Solution:</b> Check your filter settings, especially the date range. Ensure that data actually exists in the database for the selected criteria.</p>

            <h5>Problem: The reports start slowly.</h5>
            <p><b>Solution:</b> The very first time a report is started after opening SAP Business One, the initialization may take a moment. This is normal. Subsequent reports should load faster.</p>

            <h5>Problem: Performance with large amounts of data is slow.</h5>
            <p><b>Solution:</b> The reports are already optimized for SQL and HANA. To further speed up the query with very large data volumes, restrict the filter criteria (e.g., a shorter date range) as much as possible.</p>

            <h5>Problem: Crystal Reports does not work or there is a database connection error.</h5>
            <p><b>Solution:</b> Ensure that the Crystal Reports components for SAP Business One are installed correctly. Check your database connection and restart SAP Business One. If problems persist, contact your administrator.</p>
			
			<h5>Problem: BWA report does not load.</h5>
            <p><b>Solution:</b> Ensure that the BWA financial report template has been created. You can find the menu under <b>Financials > Financial Report Templates</b>. If it does not exist, you can create it yourself (as shown in the picture). The <b>standard chart of accounts can be loaded automatically via a button</b>. If problems persist, contact your administrator.</p>
